	Quiz system application will help teachers easily distribute quizzes or tests to their
students. Both Teacher and student have to create an account in order to use the program.
Teachers will be able to create quizzes for each of their classes as well as view the grades of
each student that took the quiz. Student will be able to access these quizzes and take them.
Students will need to use an access code that is given to them by the teacher in order to access
a course and each of the quizzes associated with them.

	This system will be made up of two parts, a java client application and a server backend hosting
a mySQL database. The same client will be used by both the teacher and the student and will
provide all the functionality that both roles use. The database will store all account information,
what courses and quizzes are available along with the questions and answers needed for the
quizzes themselves.

Dependencies are included in the lib fold
